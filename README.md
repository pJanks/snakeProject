# snakeProject

## Project Overview

###This project is built using HTML5, HTML Canvas, CSS3, and jQuery. It is a relatively simple game, which should require no dependencies. You can simply clone down the project and open the index.html file. The instructions as stated under the games are as follows: `The game can be started by clicking the 'Start' button. Upon 'GAME OVER', the board can be reset by clicking the 'Reset' button, and a new game can be intialized by, again, clicking the 'Start' button. You can move left with the 'A' key, up with the 'W' key, right with the 'D' key, and down with the 'S' key. The objective is to consume as many of the pills as possible without colliding with the walls or with your own tail. You will be declared a winner after you accumulate 1250 pills. Good luck!`
