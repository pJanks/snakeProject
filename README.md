# snakeProject

## Project Overview

#### This project is built using HTML5, HTML Canvas, CSS3, and JavaScript. I originally made this with jQuery, and I refactored it just to make sure my vanilla JS skills are still sharp. It also didn't make much sense for me to include the whole jQuery library when I am only using small pieces of it. It is a relatively simple game. To play, you can simply click <a href="https://pjanks.github.io/snakeProject/" target="_blank">here</a>. If you want to play around with the code feel free to clone down the project and reach out with any issues or PR's. This version is currently only tested on Chrome/Brave, but I plan to test it in other browsers in the future now that I have removed jQuery. The instructions, as stated under the games instructions tab, are as follows:
`
The game can be started by clicking the 'Start' button. Upon 'GAME OVER', the board can be reset by clicking the 'Reset' button, and a new game can be intialized by, again, clicking the 'Start' button. You can move left with the 'A' key, up with the 'W' key, right with the 'D' key, and down with the 'S' key. The objective is to consume as many of the pills as possible without colliding with the walls or with your own tail. You will be declared a winner after you accumulate 1250 pills. Good luck!`
