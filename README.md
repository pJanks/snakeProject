# snakeProject

## Project Overview

#### This project is built using HTML5, HTML Canvas, CSS3, and JavaScript. I originally made this with jQuery, and I refactored it just to make sure my vanilla JS skills are still sharp. It also didn't make much sense for me to include the whole jQuery library when I am only using small pieces of it. It is a relatively simple game. To play, you can simply clone down the project and open the index.html file in your browser. This is currently only tested on Chrome, but I plan to test in other browsers now that I've taken out jQuery. The instructions, as stated under the games instructions tab, are as follows:
`
The game can be started by clicking the 'Start' button. Upon 'GAME OVER', the board can be reset by clicking the 'Reset' button, and a new game can be intialized by, again, clicking the 'Start' button. You can move left with the 'A' key, up with the 'W' key, right with the 'D' key, and down with the 'S' key. The objective is to consume as many of the pills as possible without colliding with the walls or with your own tail. You will be declared a winner after you accumulate 1250 pills. Good luck!`
